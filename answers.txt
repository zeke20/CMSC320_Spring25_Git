Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: I use Git to track changes in my code, making collaboration, version control, and rollbacks easier. It also lets me create branches, so I can work on different features without affecting the main code.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: I can apply data science to almost any field, from healthcare to finance to marketing. For example, in finance, I can use data science to analyze customer spending patterns and predict credit risk.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging keeps both branch histories intact by creating a new commit, while rebasing rewrites history to make it linear. I use merging when I want to preserve the branch structure and rebasing when I prefer a cleaner commit history.
